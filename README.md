Project 1: A robot animation:<br/>
This is located in the folder sigapp<br/>
Use various keys to animate the robot.<br/>
You can view what keys control what body part in the code<br/>
Project 2(located in src folder):<br/>
This project uses the same robot from project one, but there is a camera following the robot as it is in a constant animation of riding a skateboard through an animated city. There are several objects loaded in to this project along with a lot of different textures as well.<br/>
You can control the robot's movements with various keys. <br/>
This project was really large so I will only post the code in how I exectuted this project.(I will also include screenshots)
